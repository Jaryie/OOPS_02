<br>	o	Release
<br>	o	Bug
<br>	o	Hotfix
<br>
<br>
3.	List the steps in a Git workflow that the team should follow when working on projects.<br>
<br>
<br>•	Choose and define branching strategy to maximise consistency
<br>•	Break down tasks into small. Logical units n commit frequently
<br>•	Write descriptive commit messages
<br>•	Pull before pushing to minimise merge conflicts by identifying and resolving differences before pushing
<br>•	Use different branches for different functions (or tasks), ex. new features, debugging, etc)
<br>•	Keep main branch clean and safe (ex. do NOT push untested/incomplete code)
<br>•	Keep repository organised and use consistent naming conventions
<br>•	Document all changes, commit, etc
